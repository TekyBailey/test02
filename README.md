# Test02
Date Created: 14 Feb 2026

### Purpose
This repository will be used to test a GitHub pages deployment using a simple HTML/CSS website. The deployment method will be from the "docs" folder of the main branch.

### Observations From Test01
1. How you name your repository affects how the url is generated. For example I named this repository "Test01" and the url generated was "https://tekybailey.github.io/Test01/". I have 2 observations about this:
- You have to type the link exactly as displayed from the pages tab. <br>
The link www.tekybailey.github.io/Test01/ is NOT allowed. 
- Capitalization is enforced (at least in the chrome browser) in the url. <br>
So the link https://tekybailey.github.io/test01/ does not work. <br><br>
**Action:** Name all repositories in lower case since most people will type the url in lower case anyway and may think the link is broken if it contains a capitalized letter and they type it as a lowercase.
